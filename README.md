# Codepath_iOS 101 - Intro to iOS Development

## üìù About This Repository

Welcome to my personal learning journal for **Intro to iOS Development (iOS101)**, a 10-week hands-on course focused on iOS app development using Swift and UIKit. This repository documents my progress, projects, and key takeaways throughout the course.

Through a mix of weekly labs, individual projects, and a final capstone project, I‚Äôll explore fundamental iOS concepts including:

- Swift programming basics
- Building user interfaces with UIKit
- Handling navigation and data persistence
- Integrating APIs to fetch real-time data
- Debugging and optimizing apps for performance

This README will be updated weekly to reflect my completed work and personal notes.
